0. Your goal is to modify your copy of bits.c so that it passes all the
tests without violating any of the coding guidelines.

1. What you should do 
    a. read the instructions in bits.c carefully.
    b. implement the first few functions.
    c. run ./check
        i.   if you break the coding rules, you will see warnings beginning with "dlc"
        ii.  if the build process failed, errors/warnings will be reported.
        iii. if your function fails to pass a testcase, you may see 
            "ERROR: test f(A, B, ...) failed. 
            Given RESULT_YOURS, should be RESULT_STANDARD"
            where f is the first failing function,
            [A, B, ...] is the arguments used to call the function,
            RESULT_YOURS is the result returned by YOUR implementation
            and RESULT_STANDARD is the correct one.
        iv. if there's no bug in your implementation, 
                then you may see ERROR of the NEXT function. JUST KEEP GOING!
    d. if all is done, feel free to try ./finalreport
        Final report tests your implementation exhaustively, rather than using only a number of test cases.
	If check fails to spot your bug that finalreport finds, run ./strictcheck to see a counterexample.
    e. there are 2 (useless) helper functions. refer to original-README for details.
2. ENJOY IT!
